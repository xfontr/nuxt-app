# Nuxt app (WIP)

This is... just some crazy boiler plate. At least, for now.

-   Configs package: Global configs shared accross the app
-   Ui package: Shared ui components
-   App package: SSR vue+nuxt app
-   Stylegen package: Utils package that turns .scss variables into .ts files

Also, includes:

-   Docker
-   Husky hooks
-   Sonar
-   Changesets
-   Dependency review

Pending:

-   CI/CD pipeline
-   Backend setup
